# CS385
This is repo recording my solution to two course project in SJTU CS385 (上海交通大学机器学习课程)

## Project1
In project1, I inplemented several machine learning methods through SVHN including

1. Basic Linear Model
    
    * Logistic Regression
    * Lasso Regression
    * Ridge Regression 
    * Spline Regression
2. Linear Analysis Mode
    * LDA
    * GNM
3. SVM
    * linear kernel
    * polynomial kernel
    * sigmoid kernel
    * RBF kernel
4. Neural Networks
    * MobileNetV3
    * NiN
    * LSTM 
    * MLP
You can refer to project1 folder which including the source code (partly handwrote) to learn some concepts about machine learning. I also give some experience and conclusion from completing this porject in my report.

## Project2
In project2 , our group gives a deep insight on various machine learing models and tasks. I am resposible for multi-category classfication tasks over CIFAR10 and Fashion-MNIST. The implemented models include:

* AlexNet
* Vgg family
* ResNet family

You can refer to project2 folder which including the source code (partly handwrote) to learn some concepts about machine learning. The link to my teammates including [CelebA](https://github.com/Dazz993/pytorch-CelebA) problem, [VAE](https://github.com/Galaxies99/VAE-pytorch/) problems, [GAN](https://github.com/Galaxies99/GAN-pytorch/) problems and LSUN problems.

## Visualization
Part of the codes I used for visualization (GradCAM, guided backpropagation, TSNE, PCA) is provided. These are just example codes.

## Ackowledgements
I give my sincerest appreciation to Prof. Zhang, Dr. Cheng and Dr. Ren for giving me this chance to contribute my efforts in the work of machine learning. I also thank them for their generous help.
